<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay Difference</h3>
<p class="spacing"><img class="image" src="images/pay-chart.jpg" alt="" style="width:670px;height:370px;margin-left:15px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s USA soccer players
make about $25,000 - $85,000 per
season, while the average is
around $40,000. Some original
players from the U.S. National
soccer team make around double
the average.The only issue is that
teamshave a cap of about
$800,000 for salaries.
Professional soccer salaries for
the men’s are much different.
They range from $25,000 to
$300,000 per player. The average
appears to be around $60,000 per
player, with many players earning
above and beyond that.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only advantage for Women</h3>
<p class="spacing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. women’s soccer games have generated
   more revenue than U.S. men’s games over
   the past three years.In 2016, women’s games
   generated $1.9 million more in revenue than
   men’s games. From 2016 to 2018, women’s
   games generated approximately $50.8 million
   in revenue, compared with $49.9 million for
   men’s games.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not only money</h3>
<p class="spacing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many difference's between women's and men's treatment. Money is
  not the only that unqual. Women's soccer doesn't receive nearly the same media
  coverage as men's soccer. According to the<img class="image" src="images/revenue.png" alt="" style="width:670px;height:700px;margin-left:15px;">
  commissioner of the Women's Premier
  Soccer League, for every twenty articles on men's soccer, women get maybe one.
  Another differentiality is playing fields. While men play on nice real grass
  fields, women play on terf fields. Most Soccer players prefer to play on grass
  over turf because, injury risk increases by 45%. Another disadvantages are
  excessive heat, and unnatural bounce of the ball significantly affect the
  performance of the game on turf. The game is played at a different speed,
  and in which you have to play in different conditions.</p>
