<h2 class="C1-H2">The difference between U.S. women's and men's has been clear stated.</h2>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay Difference</h3>
<p class="spacing"><img class="image" src="images/pay-chart.jpg" alt="" style="width:670px;height:370px;margin-left:15px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s USA soccer players
make about $25,000 - $85,000 per
season, while the average is
around $40,000. Some original
players from the U.S. National
soccer team make around double
the average.The only issue is that
teamshave a cap of about
$800,000 for salaries.
Professional soccer salaries for
the men’s are much different.
They range from $25,000 to
$300,000 per player. The average
appears to be around $60,000 per
player, with many players earning
above and beyond that.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only advantage for Women</h3>
<p class="spacing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. women’s soccer games have generated
   more revenue than U.S. men’s games over
   the past three years.In 2016, women’s games
   generated $1.9 million more in revenue than
   men’s games. From 2016 to 2018, women’s
   games generated approximately $50.8 million
   in revenue, compared with $49.9 million for
   men’s games.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not only money</h3>
<p class="spacing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many difference's between women's and men's treatment. Money is
  not the only that unqual. Women's soccer doesn't receive nearly the same media
  coverage as men's soccer. According to the<img class="image" src="images/revenue.png" alt="" style="width:670px;height:700px;margin-left:15px;">
  commissioner of the Women's Premier
  Soccer League, for every twenty articles on men's soccer, women get maybe one.
  Another differentiality is playing fields. While men play on nice real grass
  fields, women play on terf fields. Most Soccer players prefer to play on grass
  over turf because, injury risk increases by 45%. Another disadvantages are
  excessive heat, and unnatural bounce of the ball significantly affect the
  performance of the game on turf. The game is played at a different speed,
  and in which you have to play in different conditions.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is being done</h3>
  <p class="spacing">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August, mediation talks broke down between the USSF and the women's soccer team,
    with a spokesperson for the players saying they "eagerly look forward to a jury trial."
    The two sides met in New York for several days but could not reach any formal agreement.
    On Aug. 19, District Judge R. Gary Klausner set a trial date for the lawsuit
    brought against U.S. Soccer by members of the women's national team.
    The trial will begin May 5, 2020, and last four to five days.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. women
    -- the plaintiffs -- filed a motion on Sept. 9 requesting the court certify
    the players as a class. Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd and Becky
    Sauerbrunn would be appointed as class representatives. The class designation
    would award the players injunctive relief for any player who is a team member
    on the day of final judgment or appeal, as well as back pay and punitive
    damages for any player on the team at any time between Feb. 4, 2014, and the present.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The USSF, however, filed a brief opposing certification of the players' class
    status on Sept. 30. That filing contends that class certification should be
    denied because from 2014 to 2019, the proposed class representatives
     -- Morgan, Rapinoe, Lloyd and Sauerbrunn -- were paid more than the highest-earning
    men's national soccer team members "and therefore suffered no injury." In its filing,
    USSF provided charts that claimed Lloyd, Rapinoe, Sauerbrunn and Morgan
    each earned over $1.5 million (including salaries for playing in the NWSL),
    while the highest-earning men's player made $993,967. If the NWSL salaries
    are excluded, Lloyd, Rapinoe, Sauerbrunn and Morgan made just over $1.1 million.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have continued to be contentious between the two sides since the
    conclusion of the World Cup. In July, U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro
    released a letter that claimed the federation has paid the female players
    more than the men in recent years. Cordeiro's letter details analysis --
    which he says was conducted by his staff and reviewed by an accounting firm --
    that shows that U.S. Soccer paid female players $34.1 million in salaries
    and game bonuses from 2010 to '18 and paid male players $26.4 million in the same period.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was some murkiness because of the differences in the compensation
    structures for the men's and women's teams. What's more, salaries in the
    National Women's Soccer League were factored in to the calculations.
    Levinson called the letter "a sad attempt by USSF to quell the overwhelming
    tide of support the USWNT has received from everyone from fans to sponsors
    to the United States Congress.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The U.S. men's team issued a statement in
    support of the USWNT, saying, "The members of the United States National
    Soccer Team Players Association once again stands with the members of the
    world champion Women's National Team in their pursuit of fair compensation
    for their work as professional soccer players. The USMNT players were not
    impressed with US Soccer Federation president Carlos Cordeiro's letter made
    public on Monday. The Federation downplays contributions to the sport when
    it suits them. This is more of the same."
